Objectives:
Declaring function prototypes.
Implementing functions.
Using functions.

Write a program that presents three options to the user.  The menu should present whenever an Option has been concluded.  Write the program to ensure it complies with the specific options:

Each Option must make use of a function.
•	A value returning function
•	A function using a passing-by-value argument.
•	A function using a passing-by-reference argument.

Option A:
Read in the number of terms to calculate and display for the Fibonacci sequence. f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)

Option B:
Read in a sentence.  For each of the characters, output the character and the ASCII value of that character.  Each character on their own line.

Option C:
Read in two coordinates (X and Y) and a limit value.  Return two new coordinates where the coordinates have been modified using the following function: abs(coordinate - limit).

Option X:
Exit the program.
